		"MODULE_VARIABLES" : "can u analyze the code below and identify all the module level variables. PLEASE ignore variables that are local to a method or a function .. basically list every variable that is visible through the scope of the file. In case you dont find any such module/file level variable simply respond with an NA. PLEASE ENSURE THE LIST is formed correctly with quotes around values. Please do NOT add any explanations just the data structure. Exclude everything in your response except exactly the answer\n",
		"PACKAGE_VARIABLES" : "can u analyze the code below and identify all the import packages. In case the package is renamed , like import numpy as np; import scipy as sp, then i would want you to list the result like so [ { 'numpy': 'np' }, { 'scipy': 'sp' }]. Also note that at times , imported packages are separated by ','. PLEASE ENSURE THE DICTIONARY is formed correctly with quotes around keys and values. If you do not find any such references, please return NA. Please do NOT add any explanations just the data structure. Exclude everything in your response except exactly the answer\n",
		"METHODS" : "can you identify the methods / functions defined in the code below ? You will also need to identify the beginning and ending statements, code snippet, of the function and present the results like so [ { 'method_name': 'xyz' , 'method_begin': 'def xyz()', 'method_end': 'return None' },  { 'method_name': 'abc' , 'method_begin': 'def abc(x , y )', 'method_end': 'return ( a, b )' } ]. PLEASE ENSURE THE DICTIONARY is formed correctly with quotes around keys and values. If method ending isn't found simply add NA to 'method_end'. If NO method definitions are found in the code, then you can simply send an empty array. Please do NOT add any explanations just the datastructure AND PLEASE ignore method calls. I just need you to focus on methods/functions defined here. Exclude everything in your response except exactly the answer\n",
		"METHOD_ENDING": "can u identify ANY method / function endings in the code snippet below. DO NOT identify any function call or definition. Just focus on function / method endings. Results need to be in the form [ { 'method_name': 'xyz' , 'method_begin': 'def xyz()', 'method_end': 'return None' },  { 'method_name': 'abc' , 'method_begin': 'def abc(x , y )', 'method_end': 'return ( a, b )' } ].

		"CONTEXT_VARIABLES":"you will be given a few lines of code and below that you will find the changes made to the code. We will provide you with the older version of the change and the current version. Your role will be to identify all the variables within the given lines of code that are impacted by this change. PLEASE ensure to include both DIRECT impactees and INDIRECT impactees in your response. The response should be formatted like so [ {'variable_name1': < line number >, {'variable_name2': < line number >} ].PLEASE ENSURE THE DICTIONARY is formed correctly with quotes around keys and values.

		"IMPACT_DOWNSTREAM":"you will be given the following: Existing Code , Changed lines in new code and the code snippet for a file that imports OR uses the changed method. You will have to analyze the impact of the changes made to the base method and add notes on how this impacts the downstream method that imports OR uses this code. Also rate the criticality of this change with 1 being nominal and 5 being deserves immediate attention. Kindly format the data in the form of a json with 3 keys - Issues, Criticality and Recommendations. The values of these keys can be lists with as many values as you can think of and return a final dictionary with the 3 keys\n\nExisting Code :\n",
